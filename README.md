# Bike sharing prediction project

This is an AI project that is part of Udacity's Deep Learning nanodegree.
The goal is to build a neural network and use it to predict daily bike rental ridership. This is going
to be done using numpy (and not pytorch) to be able to fully understand the process and the math behind neural networks.


### Dataset

The data comes from [the UCI Machine Learning Database](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning).

This dataset has the number of riders for each hour of each day from January 1 2011 to December 31 2012. The number of riders is split between casual and registered, summed up in the cnt column.


### Dependencies

You will find a requirements.txt file describing the dependencies required to run the notebook. Since I've used the same virtual environment to do the nanodegree, it could be some dependencies that are not necessary to carry out this specific project.

You will also find a environment.yaml file. If you are using conda, you'll be able to replicate my environment just by typing:
	$ conda env create -f environment.yaml


### Work done

You can follow all the work simply by reading the ipynb file. Some functions are defined in a helper file called my_answers.py.
